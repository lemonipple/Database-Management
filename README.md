Concept

There are 5 forms of Normalization

First Normal Form (1NF): It removes all duplicate columns from the table. Creates table for related data and identifies unique column values
First Normal Form (2NF): Follows 1NF and creates and places data subsets in an individual table and defines relationship between tables using primary key
Third Normal Form (3NF): Follows 2NF and removes those columns which are not related through primary key
Fourth Normal Form (4NF): Follows 3NF and do not define multi-valued dependencies. 4NF also known as BCNF


The relationship can be defined as the connection between more than one tables in the database.

There are 4 types of relationships

One to One Relationship
Many to One Relationship
Many to Many Relationship
One to Many Relationship
